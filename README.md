# Hi, I'm Aaron Fox.

As a senior in Software Engineering at BYU-Idaho, I've always enjoyed working with computers. They are a powerful tool that allow your creativity to manifest into real works. I aspire to be a professional software engineer the industry and to eventually manage a team of my own.
