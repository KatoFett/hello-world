# Overview
As a senior in Software Engineering at BYU-Idaho, I've always enjoyed working with computers. They are a powerful tool that allow your creativity to manifest into real works. I aspire to be a professional software engineer the industry and to eventually manage a team of my own.

This program is a Hello World program, except with a "small" caveat. Most Hello World programs are overly simple and boring, especially to an experienced programmer.
I built this project around the principle that if you know what TO do, then you therefore know what NOT to do (and vice-versa). This program is what NOT to do.
